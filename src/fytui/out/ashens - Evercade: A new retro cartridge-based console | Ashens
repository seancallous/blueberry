An all-new in cartridge based console in 2020! Playing old games on the move! Exclamation mark!

What games does it play? How well does it play them? How is the dpad? Can it transform into a gelatinous cube and absorb ultraviolet light? All these questions will be answered in this video, except the last one, as it's clearly nonsense.
INFODUMP: it's called Evercade, it's a handheld games console, the games are on cartridge, they're all fully licensed, and there's a lot of support for it so far.
