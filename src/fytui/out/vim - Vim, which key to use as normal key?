I've started using vim since the last two months and have always used the Esc key till now. Of course, its a bit too far for comfort. The other option is using Ctrl+[, which I haven't been able to get used to.  
   
What keys do you use as the Normal key? And what do you recommend for someone looking to be efficient?
