Remember the bad old days when there were awful knock-off consoles that tried to fool unsuspecting grannies into disappointing kids at Christmas? Well those days apparently never went away...

Emulation-device-makers Powkiddy present the X2! It looks like a Switch, runs like a good handheld emulation console, and controls like a big pile of effluent smeared across the face of all that is good in the world!

It seems to do a decent job of emulating the original Playstation, so it's a real shame that the controls are a blight on this Earth.
