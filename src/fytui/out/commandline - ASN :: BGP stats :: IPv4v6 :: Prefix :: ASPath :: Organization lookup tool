----------------------------
BASH script to perform an autonomous system (AS) path trace for IPs or hostnames, optionally reporting detailed routing/registry data for each hop, such as  organization/network name, geographic location, etc.

IP reputation is also reported when looking up single IP addresses. This can come in handy in OSINT or incident response scenarios. 

It is also possible to search by *organization name* in order to retrieve a list of IPv4/6 network ranges related to a given company. A multiple choice menu with basic filtering capabilities will be presented if more than one organization  matches the search query.
