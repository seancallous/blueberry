Hi,

I am trying to learn more about command line and have some very basic questions to ask, been looking online for tutorials, but they are seem to gloss over the very basics? Unless someone else has a link?

In the image attached, I am looking at netstat, when i look to see all the connections that are current on my computer, why is there so many in the foreign address section as my desktop?

I understand this may be a very, very simple question but I cannot find the answer? Is this normal to have so many connections to my desktop?

Have I completely misunderstood this?

When I look and watch other people using netstat, I never see people with some many ''desktop connections''?
