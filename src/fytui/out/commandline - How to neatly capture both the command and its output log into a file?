[0] How to neatly capture both the command and its output log into a file?

----------------------------
This sounds like it should be easily doable, but I was not able to find any solution by Google search. May be I was not able to formulate the searches well.

Here is my usecase - In my work, I run benchmarking commands with different settings. Generally, I capture the output by piping it to tee (these run for long time, so tee is preferred instead of redirection to file). But lately I am seeing a need to capture the command also in log, so there is no confusion on the input parameters.

What could be a neat way to do this, preferably by just command line and no script (I run the benchmarks on many different machines).

Thanks!
