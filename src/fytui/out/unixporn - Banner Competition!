----------------------------
Hello Ricers! I've recently joined the mod team and noticed that this subreddit has no banner. For that reason, we will be holding a banner contest!

# Submission

**1. Create a banner (recommended size is 4000px by 144px)**

The banner submission should be consisted of two images: a wallpaper-like (16:9 ratio) image in the back, and an image in the front with major text and logos. This is so that reddit can properly adjust the banner on other platforms, and this allows us to reuse some of the art for our community.

Please keep all major content in the back banner centered vertically and horizontally, as reddit mobile does some weird formatting with the banner.

**2. Comment the link to the banner bellow in this format -&gt; \[Banner\] *Text and Link***

# Rewards/Ranking

The mods and/or I will be filtering the submissions and will place a final poll for the community to pick the winner.

Of course, this wouldn't be a contest without rewards. First place will get an [ultimate pack](https://www.stickermule.com/products/unixstickers-ultimate-pack) of Unixstickers from stickermule and will have their banner displayed (with credits in the sidebar), and second &amp; third places will get a Unixstickers [pro pack](https://www.stickermule.com/products/unixstickers-pro-pack).

# Notes/Rules About the Contest
