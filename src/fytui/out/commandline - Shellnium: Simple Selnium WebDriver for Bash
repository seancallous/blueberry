[https://github.com/Rasukarusan/shellnium](https://github.com/Rasukarusan/shellnium)

We can write simply by bash.

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    source ./selenium.sh
    
    main() {
        # Open the URL
        navigate_to 'https://google.co.jp'
    
        # Get the search box
        local searchBox=$(find_element 'name' 'q')
    
        # send keys
        send_keys $searchBox "animal\n"
    }
    main

We can do the following using shellnium and applescript.  
The demo is running in headless mode. It is displayed that the background of iTerm is being changed using AppleScript.
