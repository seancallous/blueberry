At last the PC Engine Coregrafx Mini has arrived! Called the Turbgrafx 16 in America. And really it should be called the Turbografx here apparently, but  the release was so incredibly tiny that nobody cares. Most of the games that you want from NEC's (well, now Konami's) little box of tricks are present, but that won't stop me being a bit miffed that Magical Chase is missing.

First there was the NES Classic Edition! Then the SNES Classic Edition! Then the C64 Mini! Then the NEOGEO mini! Then the Playstation Classic! Then the Mega Drive Mini! Now this! Blimey. Actually, does that weird ZX Spectrum joypad thing count? Dunno. And did the NEOGEO X kick start all of this? Or was it those Atari Flashback things? Or those awful AtGames Mega Drive abominations?

In case you find it useful, here's the list of included games in alphabetical order with the duplicates taken out. 52 or 55 in total, depending on how good your Japanese is. (The official number is 57 but they include duplicates, omit the two hidden games and count Ys Books I & II as one game.)
