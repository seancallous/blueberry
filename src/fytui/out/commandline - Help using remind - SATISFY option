[6] Help using remind - SATISFY option
commandline

----------------------------
Hi,

I have recently come across the [remind](https://dianne.skoll.ca/projects/remind/) calendar application and am enjoying using it. However, I am having difficulty adding some events.

In the uk (and probably else where), there is a bank holiday on the Monday following Christmas if Christmas falls on a weekend.

I have the following:

```
REM 27 Dec SATISFY [$Uw == 1] MSG Christmas Day (substitute bank holiday)
```

Which I thought would add a reminder on the 27th if the 27th is a monday although I get:

```
path/to/file/uk-hollidays.rem(50): Can't compute trigger
```

If any of you use remind, could you point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance for any help.
