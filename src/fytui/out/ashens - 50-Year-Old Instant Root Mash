Apologies for the dodgy audio: the mic failed so this is the emergency backup recording from the camcorder itself. To think the world was nearly robbed of this important historical document!

So: Swedish instant root mash. Rotomos. Over 50 years old. Will it have survived to give us its potato and turnip goodness? There's only one way to find out! (Pity I had to do it in my kitchen.)
