----------------------------
[youtube-dlc](https://github.com/blackjack4494/youtube-dlc) is a youtube-dl fork with changes and support for additional sites. youtube-dl operates as an mpv backend by default at leas on Unix, just type `mpv URL`. How to use the fork instead, I don't know.

This is likely a simple task, I don't have CLI experience much at all.
