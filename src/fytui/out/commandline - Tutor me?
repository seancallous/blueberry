Hi! I’m in a computer science couse this semester and it turns out that I’m in way over my head. I have some background in R but that’s it. Is there anybody that needs a little extra $$$ that would be willing to tutor me in Terminal/Python for a 1 or 2 hours a week until December 2nd? 

I would greatly appreciate your expertise!
