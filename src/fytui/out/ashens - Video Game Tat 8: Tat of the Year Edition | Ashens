Video Games! No longer is it enough for major publishers to offer you a game to buy. Now there must be tiered releases with statues and other collectables!  (Or a model of the Batmobile so low-quality that they dare not even release it...) And of course, don't forget to buy the tie-in noodles and candles.

We poke a stick at the infamously awful Marvel Versus Capcom Infinity stones / gems pack, a rather nice little Red Faction thingy, a Super Rare game, a Far Cry 5 Boomer Box and even a press kit about a game called "Bite the Bullet". Bonzer! Or something!
