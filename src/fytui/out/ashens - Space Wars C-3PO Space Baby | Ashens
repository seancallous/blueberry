In a galaxy far, far away from proper licensing we encounter Space Wars! The giant Lego knock-offs that make you wish you'd gone Star Trekking instead.
Wonky-eyed C-3PO will power up his skateboard and stare through his binoculars whilst he shoots at you with his hollow pistol, just like in the movies! (Well... it might have happened in one of those old Extended Universe novels. There were like a million of those so they covered A LOT of eventualities.)
