Looking for a new camera on a budget? Then this video will be completely useless for you, as it only features cameras that aren't any good!

We've got a fake DSLR that's effectively a bad webcam in a massive shell, a fake compact that's exactly the same, a terrible camcorder and - for 3 times the price - a less terrible  but still naff camcorder! And they only took about 7 months to arrive! Thanks Wish. Thish.
