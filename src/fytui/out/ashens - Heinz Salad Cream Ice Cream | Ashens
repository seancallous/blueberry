Since the invention of salad cream, people have fervently wished they had an ice cream that tastes of it. And now they do, thanks to Heinz! Or possibly it's just a cash-in on the novelty foods craze. I'll let you decide.

That's a tortured title isn't it? Officially they're called Creamz so it could have been "Heinz Creamz Salad Cream Ice Cream." Should have gone with ketchup so the title was clearer...
