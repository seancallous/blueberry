[2] Why does the resulting window take forever to respond to keyboard inputs (at first)? powershell start powershell -runas user
commandline

----------------------------
i was mucking around with runas command, and tried the following.

```powershell start powershell -runas username```

and did something like the above. I get prompted for my credentials, then it opens the powershell. cool, but it's really slow (at first). I can move the mouse and window, but it doesn't seem to respond to keyboard inputs. Takes like 30 seconds before that starts working.

What did this command do, and is that why it took so long to start responding to my inputs?
