----------------------------
This is a thread to get answers for all your questions, no matter how stupid you think it may be. Feel free to share your default setups here too, someone might have some pointers for what to do next. In short you can make any on topic comment, in any format you like, and using any host. We hope this gives new users a chance to get some help with any problems they're having and older users a chance to show off their knowledge by helping those in need.
