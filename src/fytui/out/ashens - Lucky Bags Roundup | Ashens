Good ol' Lucky Bags - a source of disappointment for young children since the 1970's! Today we cast an eye over four of them - two generic, one DC Comics flavoured and one consisting entirely of items to do with Celtic Football Club for some reason. What's in these things nowadays? (And six years ago as a couple of them are hideously out of date?) And how long does it take us to come to the conclusion that there's not much lucky about them really?

We get a crazy mish-mash of fake tattoos, crap stickers, rotten sweets and even weaponry! What a time to be alive.
