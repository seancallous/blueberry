----------------------------
Is there a plugin to aid subtitle editing in vim? Unfortunately, so far I was only able to find an [Emacs major mode](https://github.com/rndusr/subed/)...

The main thing I am interested in is the ability to sync the current subtitle with a video (e.g. being played in mpv).
