[3] Tabs instead of spaces with python
vim

Hi! I stared using vim recently and I have a question about changing tabs into spaces.

When I'm editing normal text files tabs are normal tab characters 8 spaces long. But when I'm editing files with #!/bin/python on the first line then every tab that I place changes into 4 spaces and I don't want that. I want my tabs to behave as normal tabs and be 8 spaces long.

What setting should I add to /etc/vimrc to have tabs in every file I'm editing?

EDIT: never mind I just found answer to my question. I just had to add this:

`let g:python_recommended_style = 0`
