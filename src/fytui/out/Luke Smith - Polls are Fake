----------------------------
Don't give any faith to polls even if you trust the pollster to be honest. Forecasting electoral events is like trying to hit a moving target with a blindfold on. Polls if anything are causal on electoral events, and serve to convince people what they should believe based on peer pressure. It's actually pretty amazing that people still talk about polls as if they are anything serious. Any minor systematic error in such a complex system and it all comes crashing down.
