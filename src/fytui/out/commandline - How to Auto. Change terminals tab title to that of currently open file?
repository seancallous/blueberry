My goal is that when I open a file (regardless of editor, fwiw I use Micro) to automatically show the filename in the tab title and when I exit/quit the editor revert the tab title back to what is was. How do I acheieve this?

note: I am aware this easy with vim/neovim but thats not what I use, I almost exclusively use Micro Editor and rarely Nano.
