# shift+o is too slow

So this is a problem I have been noticing for a few days. Whenever I try to insert a newline above the current line using shift+o, a capital O appears (even though I'm in normal mode), stays there for about 1sec, vanishes and then a newline appears. Here is a video capturing the event. Notice at around 15 sec.
