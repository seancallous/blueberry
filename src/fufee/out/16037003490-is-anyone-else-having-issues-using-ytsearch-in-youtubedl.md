# Is anyone else having issues using ytsearch in youtube-dl?

6 | 1603700349.0

I'm trying to run some scraping scripts to capture some archive footage on a few
channels I babysit and the ytsearch function appears to be completely broken for
me.

In light of the recent events I was uncertain if I'd do more good than harm by
doing this through official channels at the moment. Is anyone else having
this issue at the moment?

EDIT_01: I'm also asking this here because I know that ytsearch is kind of an
npm orphan child of a tool, and I was hoping that maybe some of you who have
more experience using ytsearch via npm and less experience using it encapsulated
inside of youtube-dl may have had some luck solving this issue.
