Hi, tried a internet search no luck, please could some point me in the correct direction. Trying to change this colour, its yellow from the vim colortest script. I have no idea what i need to change. Quite happy to change yellow for good in terminal if i have too, this yellow colour is not in my system palette.  Popup is from FZF Marks. Thanks. Vim 8, uxterm, on Arch. 

Also using `set termguicolors`
