# Pdf View, no plugins

7 | 1603520438.0

I want to create a command to view PDFs generated by my LaTeX compiler. I don't want to use plugins because my machine is trash. Any suggestions? I tried `command ViewPdf !mupdf %:r &amp;` and it did not work.

Edit: Using this command as a keymap, it works. I didn't want that because I want to understand a little more about vim
