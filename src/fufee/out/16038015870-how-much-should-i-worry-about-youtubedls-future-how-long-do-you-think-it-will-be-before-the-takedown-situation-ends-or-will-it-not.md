# How much should I worry about youtube-dl's future? How long do you think it will be before the take-down situation ends, or will it not?

I don't know how concerned to be, I just think that worst case scenario,   google ends up patching YouTube's servers from youtube-dl or something   like that. It was actually earlier this month I began to finally  backup  my YouTube viewing history, and even though my Python script to  do isn't  perfect, it downloads most videos and will deploy it for my  entire  viewing history, and backup all the videos onto Google Photos.
