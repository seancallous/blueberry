# Carbon Now Sh

2 | 1603650891.0

Hi there,

I've tried to install the  vim-carbon-now-sh plugin from  'kristijanhusak/vim-carbon-now-sh' . But once I got the code selected and I run the command :CarbonNowSh it doesn't take the code I selected, I tried in visual mode and in V-Line mode, but none of those worked.

Does anyone have this plugin up and running ?

Thanks

Edit: Already solved the problem by the author u/kristijanhusak thx &lt;3
