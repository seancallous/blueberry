# Can someone help me make a very simple boilerplate for flags/options for a python command-line program? Just a general or generic starting point for a python CLI.

I have struggled a bit with getting my head around a basic implementation.  I made something work, but I had no idea how it was working, other than I followed a tutorial. Is there any code or demystifying tutorial you would recommend?  The only thing that makes sense to me thoroughly is doing it manually, and there are quite a few pitfalls with this. Not that fully understand outside of a library makes it work better, and wrangling/cleaning input for weird substitution/injection mishaps. Thanks for any insight you can provide!
