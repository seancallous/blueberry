# quick tip.

you can use :ab to use vim's in-built snippets.

example:

        :ab af () =&gt; {&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;}

this will expand af to an arrow funtion if you hit space, Enter or a few other keys.

this for now puts you at the end of the block. we can fix this by saying:

        :ab af () =&gt; {&lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;}&lt;Up&gt;

Now this puts you inside the block now you probably get the pitch. hit &lt;CTRL-V&gt; to stop it from expanding. it is &lt;CTRL-Q&gt; for windows. to remove snippet,type:

        :unab af

for more help type

        :h :ab
