# What is the most-suitable language for wrapping unix utilities?

2 | 1603772510.0

The languages that i have in mind is are:

* sh

* perl 5

Now sh is good for scripting, and portable.
Included in pretty much every unix(-like).

Perl 5 is a scripting language, [and its very very portable](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlport).

Im torn apart between these two what is the most-suitable for the job?
