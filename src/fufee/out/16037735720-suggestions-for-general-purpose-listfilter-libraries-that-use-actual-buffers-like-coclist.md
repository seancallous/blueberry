# Suggestions for general purpose list-filter libraries that use actual buffers (like coc-list)

Hi,

Many of us use and love fzf at this point, but as someone that bounces back and forth between an emacs setup quite often, something I miss in my (n)vim is how integrated ivy feels for searching through lists of just about anything.

I'm curious if anyone else is using or has made any tools like coc-list out there, that provide a simple interface for doing lists of things in an actual vim buffer instead of a terminal buffer. Has anyone experienced trying to make this approach work with giant grep inputs?
