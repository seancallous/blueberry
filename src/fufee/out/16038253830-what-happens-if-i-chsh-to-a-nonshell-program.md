# What happens if I "chsh" to a non-shell program

3 | 1603825383.0

If I want to switch to `fish` from `bash`, I can do something like `chsh /usr/bin/fish`. But what if I change it to something like `/usr/bin/firefox`. Does the system keep a list of certified shell programs? But then I won't be allowed to write my own shell and use it. Or does it somehow detect if its a shell or not. Or am I fucked?

Thanks in advance
