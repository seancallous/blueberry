# Best Vim Colorscheme for Haskell/Elm

2 | 1603601046.0

Hello! I use vim for both Haskell and Elm, but most popular colorschemes I've tried seem kinda flat so far. To be fair I have only tried onehalfdark/light and gruvbox, but both colorschemes lack color.   


Anyone know any good colorschemes for those languages?
