# vim for windows

0 | 1603562974.0

must school/college/universities force in some way using windows (with free student license). As a student who likes the vim Idea but use windows its feels like its not meant to be. For now I use vs-code with vim extension but it has different approach ( specially with buffers and tabs). (I meanly use it for python and it is very comfortable with build in test, and running selective lines and entire file)

My question what vim user on windows do? If you use vim vs-code how is your workflow set (and if it possible to recommend a **setting.json** that will be good for start)
