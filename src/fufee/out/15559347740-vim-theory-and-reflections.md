# Vim theory and reflections

Why Vim?  Feel free to post your thoughts.  Mods if I'm over stepping, feel free to delete.

**First a posting guide for new folks:**

* Cool vim keyboard? r/vimkeyboard
* Cool vim setup? r/vimporn
* Neovim question or comment? r/neovim
* Neat colorscheme? r/unixporn
* Cool vim tattoos? r/ATBGE
* I'm sure I'm missing some, feel free to add those too

**Resources:**

* :h &lt;topic&gt;
* [Romainl's gists](https://gist.github.com/romainl/4b9f139d2a8694612b924322de1025ce)
* [https://vimways.org/2018/](https://vimways.org/2018/)
* [Vim cheatsheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)
* Freenode/IRC #vim and r/vim chat
* Etc.

*Caveat: I'm only a little more than a year into Vim and this community, but I like it here and I hope you will too.*

**What is Vim?**

* Vim is an efficient editor with minimal frills to help us write and develop code in a way that suits our PERSONAL needs.Vim is not and IDE and it's not a solution to every problem.

**Why is** r/vim **so elitist?**

* It's not.  Everybody here (literally EVERYBODY HERE) wants you to be successful.   BUT many people follow Vim philosophies you may or may not agree with.
* If you like other tools: VScode, Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.  That's great!  Use them if they fit your needs; they are great tools.  Trying to make Vim behave like one of those tools is missing the point.
* Vim has a great plugin structure where you can share your tools and ideas.  Use what others have built, but don't collect them all and don't assume every solution is a plugin or hotkey away.  Your config and your plugins are personal to you and are only good when they do what YOU want.  Nobody else knows what you need or solves problems the same way.
* The power of Vim is personalization for editing.  If you want to copy a config, go checkout r/spacevim but to many in this community that is missing the point.  Your configurations should be organic and you have to put in the effort to learn the tool if you ever want it to really work for you.
* Just because you can do something with Vim doesn't mean you should.  It's not a calendar, it's not an email client, it's not a terminal emulator, it's not a fuzzy finder, etc. etc.  There are already good solutions for all of those problems.

**So why are you here?**

* You want help with your config and you've searched stackoverflow and read :help as well as done vimtutor more times than you can count.
* Your configurations/plugins are broken and you've already asked for help on their github pages or support.
* You found something cool Vim can do and you want to share it.
* You found another great resource and you want to share.
* You love working in Vim and want to help other people.

These are just my reflections reading the threads over the last month.  Everybody here is smart and has a busy life.  The answers are in :help and on the web for everyone to find and use before you craft a post.   This community is a great resource when you've already done your homework and you have a clear question, solution, or something to share.  However, if your whole reason to post here is because you want to copy color schemes and take someone else's config, I think you've missed the point, and that's not what you're likely to find.  I'm bothered by the influx of new blood who are eager but want to try to make this sub into something it isn't.
