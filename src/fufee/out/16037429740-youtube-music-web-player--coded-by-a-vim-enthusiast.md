I was just looking at what the hotkeys were for the YouTube Music web player ([https://music.youtube.com/](https://music.youtube.com/)) and had a nice surprise! Here are some highlights:

&gt;**Playback**  
&gt;  
&gt;Play/Pause  **;**  
&gt;  
&gt;Next song **j**  
&gt;  
&gt;Previous song **k**  
&gt;  
&gt;Forward 10 s **l**  
&gt;  
&gt;Back 10 s **h**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Navigation**  
&gt;  
&gt;Go to Home **gh**  
&gt;  
&gt;Go to Explore **ge**  
&gt;  
&gt;Go to Library **gl**  
&gt;  
&gt;Go to Settings **g,**  
&gt;  
&gt;Search **/**

You can bring up the full list in the player by pressing `?`.  Now, if only YouTube could adopt the same set...
