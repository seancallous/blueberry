# vim as HTML editor

23 | 1603563736.0

Hi,

I am new to coding and vim.

I am looking for an advice (from people with experience) on how to best work with vim when writing with HTML CSS

What is the best way to modify vim so that:

1. it does some sort of automatic tag completion or tag closing
2. is there a way to have straight vertical lines to give a graphical representation for the relative relationship between opening tag and closing tag
3. what is the best way to
   1. have an overview of all files in one project
   2. move quickly between file.

I'd be happy to receive any other advice 

Thanks in advance
