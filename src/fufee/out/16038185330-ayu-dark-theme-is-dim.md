# Ayu dark theme is dim

0 | 1603818533.0

New to vim in general. I have installed the Ayu theme, as that's what I was using with VScode. However, the theme looks very dull on vim/nvim in comparison to the screenshots on the github page as well as the VScode version. [Others](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-vim/issues/56) seem to also be having a similar problem. Was wondering if anyone had a similar issue.
