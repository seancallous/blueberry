20 | 1603692961.0

Hi everyone! I am a university student and I am in a class called Magazine / Feature writing and I have an assignment called "Front of the Book". This assignment allows me to write a profile/s about individuals who are interested in interesting stuff! Naturally, unixporn is one of my first thoughts on a pretty unique take of tech and would love to write about 1 or more of you all. I don't really need any personal identifying information, I am mostly looking for questions like: Why do you rice? How much time do you spend ricing? How did you first get into ricing? How do you prepare ricing (like do you have a process, sketch things out)? Do you have a style you like to follow? If so, how did you develop that style? Etc (The more information the better :)).

My pms are open, and I would also love to talk to you on discord if you would be willing. Just pm me in advance.
