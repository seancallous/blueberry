# for that wordhunt idea
# 1 get a huge list of russian words
# 2 in batches scrape woodhunt for the translation list
# 3 save them in to a file with formatting:
# russian_word && keyboard_swapped || translation, translation, translation
# 4 fzf search the file with the first 2 columns
# this way i'll get a good thesaurus if a search the definitions column because it will display multiple lines with translations
